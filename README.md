1. Begin by entering the URL of your desired source Wikipedia page into the the first field. 
2. Enter the maximum search depth level desired*.
3. Select a search mode.
    There are 3 search modes available:
    - Search for links from the 1st paragraph  
        Uses links found within the 1st paragraph (of the introduction) of each Wikipedia page to generate a graph.
    - Search for links from the introduction      
        Uses links found within the introduction (may contain multiple paragraphs) of each Wikipedia page to generate a graph.
    - Search for links from the entire page   
        Uses links found within the entire page to generate a graph.
4. Click on 'Create my graph!'.
5. Voil√†!

 *Unforunately, the maximum search level that works on the server which hosts this application is 2. Nonetheless, you should be able to run the programme to your heart's content at **any** search depth on a development server.
